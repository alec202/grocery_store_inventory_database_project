# Introduction

Our project will be an inventory Database Management 
system for a grocery store. It will store information on 
different products. For instance an apple, our system 
would store information like the name (for the type of 
apple), the price, type of product (electronics vs. food. 
vs. clothing), barcode/sku number, etc.
This Database would be shown on a GUI and allow the user 
to interact with the GUI and do things like change the 
price of the product, change the quantity of the product 
we have, etc. Then these changes would be 
stored/reflected in our Database.
The database would hold all the information we need, and 
the GUI will just display that information to the user

# Anticipated Technologies

We will be using Python 3.11 to build this project as 
well as Tkinter since it's a built in library that comes 
with Python. Another technology we will use would be SQL 
and the library SQLite that comes built into Python as this 
would allow us to make a RDBMS stored on our 
own laptops but by still using SQL commands.

# Method/Approach

Right now, our estimated plan of attack is to share the 
components of the project. What we mean by this 
is that we will all each spend time learning 
Tkinter (or whatever GUI library we ultimately decide on) and
also on learning SQL and how to use SQLite. Then we will continue having our meetings
and discussing functions/methods. We will then split up the functions/methods and divy up the 
work as we discuss/create each of the methods.


# Estimated Timeline

The first major milestone would be for us all to feel comfortable with Tkinter and SQL/SQLite to 
the
point where we can begin programming the project. We anticipate this taking 4 weeks of time.
The second major milestone would be for us to finalize the layout for how we want out GUI to 
look. We anticipate this taking 3 weeks approximately.
The third Major milestone would be getting a prototype of the GUI working. We anticipate this 
taking 1.5 weeks after we're all comfortable with Tkinter.
The fourth milestone would be creating all the 
methods/functions to modify the database and for them to 
be working. We anticipate this taking 2 weeks after we're all comfortable with SQLite.
The fifth major milestone would be programming a gui that has the layout we want. We anticipate 
this taking 2 weeks after we're all comfortable with Tkinter.
The sixth major milestone would be connecting all the functions from the GUI together with the 
functions from our other classes. We anticipate this taking 4 weeks after we're all comfortable 
with Tkinter and SQLite.



# Anticipated Problems

No one in the group has worked created a working GUI from 
start to finish nor has anyone worked with SQL before. Additionally, 
not everyone is at the same comfort level when using 
Python.
