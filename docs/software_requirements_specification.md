# Overview
This is our software requirements specification. It's purpose is to specify 
functional and non-functional behavior about our software. A requirement is 
a capability (functionality) or a condition (constraint) to which our 
software must conform to. Requirements are specifications of what should 
be 
implemented. They are descriptions of how the system and its 
attributes should behave.
